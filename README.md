# User Management API
Implement user signup and login endpoints with detailed user information returned (excluding sensitive details like passwords).
Ensure password security by using hashing techniques.
Leverage TypeScript for type safety.
Ensure seamless database interactions using MySQL (or preferred database).

## Technologies Used
- NestJS - Backend framework
- TypeScript - Programming language
- MySQL - Relational database (or preferred alternative)
- bcrypt - For password hashing
- Database Setup

Create a MySQL database named employees.
## Create a users table with the following schema:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mobile VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_login TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ip_address VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
### API Endpoints
Signup API (POST `/signup`)
- Request Body:
    - name - User's full name
    - mobile - User's unique mobile number
    - password - User's chosen password
- Response:
    - JSON response with the new userâ€™s details (excluding password).
- Functionality:
    - Validates uniqueness of the mobile number.
    - Hashes the password securely with bcrypt.
    - Inserts the new user into the database.
    - Returns a success response with user details (excluding password).
Login API (POST `/login`)
- Request Body:
    - mobile - User's unique mobile number
    - password - User's password
- Response:
    - JSON response with user details (excluding password) if login is successful.
    - Error response if credentials are invalid.
    - Functionality:
    - Validates mobile number and password.
    - Retrieves the user from the database.
    - Verifies the password using bcrypt.
    - Returns a success response with user details (excluding password) on successful login.

## Project Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/mdaijaj/user_managment_.git
```
cd `user-management-api`
Install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
Set up environment variables (e.g., database connection settings) in .env:
```
SECRET_KEY = "23123213"
DB_PASSWORD = aadilraza339
DB_NAME = employees
DB_HOST = localhost
```

Start the server:

```
yarn run start
```

Security Considerations

Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` for secure storage.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent `brute-force` attacks (not covered here, but recommended).
Input Validation: Use ValidationPipe to validate and sanitize user input.
Authentication: For session management, consider `JWT` or another authentication strategy for production use.
Testing

Unit Tests: Write tests for controllers, services, and entities to verify proper functionality and error handling.
Integration Tests: Use Jest or similar frameworks to simulate API requests and ensure correct response handling.
Example JSON Response

For both login and signup requests (on success):
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "mobile": "******1234",
    "status": true
}
```
